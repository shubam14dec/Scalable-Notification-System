# Asyncify — Task Board

Per the asyncify-engineering skill: plans land here as checkable items
before implementation; items get checked off as they complete; finished
plans get a short review section, then move to Done.

## Backlog (next candidates, in rough value order)

- [ ] Landing page for asyncify.org (public face; domain currently unpointed)
- [ ] Release automation: Changesets + GitHub Actions publish pipeline
      (fresh npm token straight into GitHub Secrets)
- [ ] CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml): typecheck + vitest + builds
      on every push (deliberately deferred earlier)
- [ ] Compliance gap set from email-delivery skill §5: List-Unsubscribe /
      RFC 8058 headers on P2 email, public unsubscribe endpoint, consent
      fields on subscribers, marketing footer block
- [ ] npm workspaces wiring for packages/ (deferred from Phase D)

## In progress

(nothing — between tasks)

## Done (compressed history)

- Phases A–G: engine, accounts, integrations, dashboard, SDKs + widget,
  topics, conditions + open tracking, MJML templates — all verified, all
  pushed (see git log for the full story)
- Published @asyncify-hq/node@0.1.0 + @asyncify-hq/react@0.1.0
- Test suite (51 tests) + instant key-revocation fix
- Skill library: asyncify-engineering (main) + email-delivery (domain)
